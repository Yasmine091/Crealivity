### 👩🏻‍💻 About Me  

I’m a **software engineer** and the mind behind **[Crealivity](https://crealivity.eu/)**.  
Development isn’t just my job, it’s my passion. I love building side projects, experimenting with new technologies, and sharing useful tools with the community.  

I started coding at 12 (thanks to Visual Basic ✨), and I’ve been hooked ever since. By day I work as a full-stack developer; by night I tinker with side projects, explore new stacks, and keep Crealivity moving forward.  

- 🌍 Based somewhere in the middle of nowhere 🌌  
- 🖥️ Check out my portfolio at [crealivity.eu](https://crealivity.eu)  
- ✉️ Reach me at [y.contact@malaxit.eu](mailto:y.contact@malaxit.eu)
- 🤝 Open to collaborating on cool, impactful projects  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I’m secretly a duck… but don’t tell anyone 🦆
