# 👋🏼 Hi there!

I'm **Yasmine**, a **full-stack developer** passionate about building software that’s both impactful and well-crafted.
I started coding at **12 years old** (thanks, Visual Basic 😄) and never really stopped since.

I recently completed my **Software Architect & Developer diploma**, and I’m now looking for a **fully remote, full-time position**, fixed-term or permanent, where I can keep growing, contribute to meaningful projects, and collaborate with creative teams.

### 🌱 What I’m looking for

I’m most at home in **small, dynamic teams** where there’s space to experiment and take ownership.
My goal is to shift from freelance work toward **long-term, product-driven projects**, focusing on building real, lasting value.

### 💡 A few things about me

* **Self-taught, curious, and persistent**, I learned by doing long before formal study.
* **Creative problem-solver**, I love finding clean solutions to complex issues.
* **Independent but collaborative**, I can drive my own work, yet I thrive in well-aligned teams.
* **Always experimenting**, from backend APIs to UI/UX details, I enjoy the full stack.

### 💬 Let’s connect

If you’re looking for a developer who blends independence with curiosity and hands-on experience, let’s talk.
I’d love to learn more about your projects or opportunities.
